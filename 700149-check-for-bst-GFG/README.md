Given the root of a binary tree. Check whether it is a BST or not.
A&nbsp;BST&nbsp;is defined as follows:


The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with data less than the node's data.


The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with data greater than the node's data.


Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


Examples:
Input: root = [2, 1, 3, N, N, N, 5]
Output: true 
Explanation: The left subtree of every node contains smaller data and right subtree of every node contains greater data. Hence, the tree is a BST.
Input: root = [2, N, 7, N, 6, N, 9] Output: false 
Explanation: Since the node to the right of node with data 7 has lesser value 6, hence it is not a valid BST.
Input: root = [10, 5, 20, N, N, 9, 25]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with data 9 present in the right subtree has lesser key value than root node 10.
Constraints:1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 1051 ≤ node-&gt;data ≤ 109
