# [Binary Tree to DLL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/binary-tree-to-dll/1?page=1&difficulty=Hard&sortBy=submissions)
## Hard
Given the root of a binary tree, convert it to a Doubly Linked List (DLL) in place, using the same node structure.

The left and right pointers in the binary tree nodes should be used as prev and next pointers respectively in the resulting DLL.
The DLL should be formed by performing an inorder traversal of the binary tree (i.e., Left -&gt; Root -&gt; Right).
The first node in the inorder traversal (i.e., the leftmost node) should become the head of the DLL.

Return the head of the resulting DLL.
Examples:
Input: root = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 2 1 33 1 2Explanation: Inorder traversal visits 2, 1, 3. Node 2 becomes the head of the DLL, giving the list 2 &lt;=&gt; 1 &lt;=&gt; 3.
Input: root = [10, 20, 30, 40, 60]
Output: 40 20 60 10 30 
30 10 60 20 40 
Explanation: Inorder traversal visits 40, 20, 60, 10, 30. Node 40 becomes the head of the DLL, giving the list 40 &lt;=&gt; 20 &lt;=&gt; 60 &lt;=&gt; 10 &lt;=&gt; 30.
