# [Minimize the Heights II](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimize-the-heights3351/1?page=1&category=Arrays&sortBy=submissions)
## Medium
Given an array arr[] denoting heights of n towers and a positive integer k. 
For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by k
Decrease the height of the tower by k

Find out the minimum possible difference between the height&nbsp;of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.
You can find a slight modification of the problem&nbsp;here.Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by k for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.
Examples :
Input: k = 2, arr[] = [1, 5, 8, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The array can be modified as [1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k] = [3, 3, 6, 8]. The difference between the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.

Input: k = 3, arr[] = [3, 9, 12, 16, 20]
Output: 11
Explanation: The array can be modified as [3+k, 9+k, 12-k, 16-k, 20-k] = [6, 12, 9, 13, 17]. The difference between the largest and the smallest is 17-6 = 11.&nbsp;
